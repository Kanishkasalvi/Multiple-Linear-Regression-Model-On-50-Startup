# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model-On-50-Startup
🚀 Project Update: Multiple Linear Regression in Machine Learning

🔍 Objective:

Built a predictive model to determine company profit using features such as R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend from the 50_Startups.csv dataset.

💻 What I Did:
Performed data preprocessing, including handling categorical variables with one-hot encoding.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Developed a Multiple Linear Regression model using Python's scikit-learn library.
Evaluated model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

📚 What I Learned:
Deepened my understanding of data preprocessing and the importance of feature selection in building accurate predictive models.
Gained hands-on experience in implementing and evaluating Multiple Linear Regression models.
Enhanced my skills in data visualization to effectively communicate model results.

📊 Result/Conclusion:
The model successfully predicted profit with a good fit, as indicated by the R-squared value.
This project has solidified my foundation in regression analysis and its practical applications in data science.
